Hello, welcome to my blog! This blog was inspired by a weird hobby of mine. It's something that I do out of curiosity and typically does not involve anyone other than myself. What is my hobby you ask? Well, on my spare time, I analyze public policies through open data and write papers about them. Unsurprisingly, many find it unique and sometimes . . . weird!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Growing up, I used to beat myself over the meaningless scribbles written on my blue notebook. I felt like no one truly understood the chicken scratch I treasured so much. But, that was okay. I never blamed my friends for not sharing the same interest as mine. After all, we often offer genuine appreciation without showing interest in matters we do not understand. I mean, I do it too. When my mother speaks to me in her terms as a hairstylist, I can only respect and appreciate what she does for a living (And, she tries to feed me to this day, no matter how old I get). So, I never expected my works to allure elated response from anyone. I just enjoyed learning something new, and that was it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, people began paying attention to my hobby in recent years. As I learned various essential tools in computer programming, I also developed ways to communicate my findings graphically. I found that when people look at infographics, they seem to understand the driving force behind my curiosity of things. The adage, "A picture is worth a thousand words," lingers in mind as I am creating this blog. Anyway, I really hope you'll enjoy my research findings. Thanks for reading a bunch of gobbledygook I wrote here.</p>

The map you see above is an interactive map illustrating every reported crime occured in the month of January, 2016. You will see a lot of these interactive graphic tools in my blog. In case you're wondering what coding program I am using to generate these maps, my foundation is mainly R. But, I must add that although R is handy dandy, I generate many maps using various external packages such as ArcGIS and Shiny App. I use external packages because writing a script for each and every element is for one, out of my abilities (I'm considered a noob in the computer industry), and two, it doesn't make sense to create something when something better is already out in the market.</p>
