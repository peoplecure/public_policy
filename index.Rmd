Hi there! Welcome to my blog. This blog is mostly about my weird hobby, which many people find it unique - analyzing open data and writing papers about them. It's something that I do out of curiosity and typically don't share it with anyone. However, in recent years, I have learned some essentials of basic computer coding and realized that I could share my hobby with everyone without scaring them.

You see, when I show people blocks of text on a piece of paper, they see me as a nerdy guy. But, once I present infographics to those same individuals — such as what you see below — reactions take about a turn, and they finally understand the driving force behind my curiosity of things. The adage, "A picture is worth thousand words," is meant for this type of situations. So, instead of writing papers, I've decided to create graphic images and share them via this blog. I hope you'll enjoy them as much as I do.</p>

The map you see above is an interactive map illustrating every reported crime occured in the month of January, 2016. You will see a lot of these interactive graphic tools in my blog. In case you're wondering what coding program I am using to generate these maps, my foundation is mainly R. But, I must add that although R is handy dandy, I generate many maps using various external packages such as ArcGIS and Shiny App. I use external packages because writing a script for each and every element is for one, out of my abilities (I'm considered a noob in the computer industry), and two, it doesn't make sense to create something when something better is already out in the market.</p>
