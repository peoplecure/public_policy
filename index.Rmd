Team Hope is a nonprofit organization whose members are dedicated to serving the residents of District 7. We are building substantive findings for the community in a promising effort to alleviate the burdens of those suffering hardship. Through affordable housing and community projects, we wish to improve the standard of living and pave success pathways for the members of our community. By next summer, our new renovated facility will include a late-night childcare center and a homeschool facility. Right here on Fort Chaplin.</p>

The map you see above is an interactive map illustrating every reported crime occured in the month of January, 2016. You will see a lot of these interactive tools in our website because we believe information should be fun and engaging. We could have posted a large tabulation table with percentage figures and stuff, but those are so boring and tables are nowhere close to fun.</p>
