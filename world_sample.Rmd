The Classical Model vs. Keynesian Economics: The Basics

<p style="text-align: justify; width: 600px;">
As with many academic disciplines, there are fundamental theories in the field of economics that functions as the foundation and bedrock of growing research. Today, I would like to briefly explain two important theories that complement quite well with each other. First is the **Classical Model**, which economists use to evaluate the *long-term* economic outcome of a nation. The Classical Model looks at elements like technology, working labor force, availability of physical and natural resources, and human capital to forecast economic trends. The second, which I misspell too often, is called **Keynesian Economics**, and this theory looks at the *short-term* impact of market activities by assessing government spending, consumption, investments, and net exports. In case you haven't noticed yet, the map above illustrates the absolute value of these elements in a global spectrum, and every slide is related to the two economic models you will learn here.
