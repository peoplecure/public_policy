As with many academic disciplines, there are fundamental theories in the field of economics that functions as the foundation and bedrock of growing knowledge. I would like to write about two of them here. First is "Classical Model", and the second, which I always mispell oh so often, is called "Keynesian Economics."

In the Classical Model, economists evaluate long-term economic outcome of a nation using elements like technology, working labor force, availability of physical and natural resources, and human captial.

By contrast, the Keynesian model focuses on the short-term impact of market elements.
