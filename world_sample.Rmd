The Classical Model vs. Keynesian Economics: The Basics</p><br>

<h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As with many academic disciplines, there are fundamental theories in the study of economics that functions as the foundation and bedrock of growing research. Today, I would like to briefly explain two important theories that complement quite well with each other. First is the *Classical Model*, which economists use to evaluate the long-term economic outcome of a nation. The Classical Model looks at elements like technology, working labor force, availability of physical and natural resources, and human captial to forecast economic trends. The second, which I always mispell too often, is called *Keynesian Economics*, and this one looks at the short-term impact of market activities by assessing govenment spending, market consumption, investments, and net export. In case you haven't noticed yet, the map above illustrate the absolute value of these elements in a global spectrum, and every slide is related to the two economic models you will learn here.</p>
