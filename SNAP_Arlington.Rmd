If you have ever visited the [Arlington County's website](https://departments.arlingtonva.us/dhs/dhs-performance-measurement-program/), you may have noticed that the county's Economic Independence Division has a winning goal: "Increase SNAP participation rate and amount of SNAP benefits issued to eligible Arlington County residents." Asides from altruistic reasons, it is economically sensible for local governments to promote SNAP participation for eligible residents.   <br><br>  Before we begin, I want you to know that I am not advocating for a particular public policy. This blog is not about fueling my political ardor. Believe me. I have my opinions about world matters just like you. But, when it comes to public policy, I want to look at things impartially, free from personal feelings and biases as much as possible. My primary goal is to objectively measure government programs and policies for the good of the public. So, if you're against social policies like food stamps, please hold onto your horses.    <br><br>    That said, why is SNAP economically sensible for local governments? Well, in short-terms, the answer is straightforward. SNAP, formally known as food stamps, is a federal program designed to help low-income earners with food. It means that the program is funded by the federal government. When residents spend that federal money in their neighborhood, their regional economic activity increases. And, with the additional economic movement, the local government generates more revenue from taxes.</p></div>

<br><br><br><h4><div class="newspaper1"><p style="text-align: justify;">
It isn't just local governments that are reaping the benefits of food stamps. Food stamps are a major source of revenue for many businesses. Take Walmart for example. [In 2013, Walmart siphoned nearly 18 percent of all food stamps spending, which equals to about 14 billion dollars](https://www.wsj.com/articles/grocers-brace-for-reduction-in-food-stamps-1383168686?tesla=y). For a company that generates about half a trillion dollars each year, the SNAP program is a lucrative market. So, why would any economist tasked to revitalize their local government not consider promoting SNAP?</p></div>
