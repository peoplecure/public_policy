If you have ever visited the [Arlington County's website](https://departments.arlingtonva.us/dhs/dhs-performance-measurement-program/), you may have noticed that the county's Economic Independence Division has a winning goal: "Increase SNAP participation rate and amount of SNAP benefits issued to eligible Arlington County residents." Asides from altruistic reasons, it is economically sensible for local governments to promote SNAP participation for eligible residents.   <br><br>  Before we begin, I want you to know that I am not advocating for a particular public policy. This blog is not about fueling my political ardor. Believe me. I have my opinions about world matters just like you. But, when it comes to public policy, I want to look at things impartially, free from personal feelings and biases as much as possible. My primary goal is to objectively measure government programs and policies for the good of the public. So, if you're against social policies like food stamps, please hold onto your horses.    <br><br>    That said, why is SNAP economically sensible for local governments? Well, in short-terms, the answer is straightforward. SNAP, formally known as food stamps, is a federal program designed to help low-income earners with groceries. It means that the program is funded by the federal government. When residents spend that federal money in their neighborhood, their regional economic activity increases. And, with the additional economic movement, local governments generate more revenue from taxes.  <br><br>    It isn't just local governments that can benefit from food stamps. Food stamps are a major source of revenue for many businesses. Take Walmart for example. [In 2013, Walmart siphoned nearly 18 percent of all SNAP purchase, which equals to about 14 billion dollars](https://www.wsj.com/articles/grocers-brace-for-reduction-in-food-stamps-1383168686?tesla=y). Even for a company that generates about half a trillion dollars each year, the SNAP program is a lucrative market. So, why would any economist tasked to revitalize their local government not consider promoting SNAP?</p></div>

Another reason governments might want to increase SNAP participation rate, albeit a debatable argument, is that of something called *marginal propensity to consume (MPC)*. In the context of our discussion, MPC is simply the proportion of income people spend on purchasing goods. So, for example, if you spend 75 cents per dollar of your income, then you have a high MPC. On the other hand, if you spend 30 cents per dollar, then you have a low MPC rate.   <br><br>    Some people have said to me that low-income earners have little money, so they buy inexpensive stuff or live a frugal lifestyle. However, [some empirical studies](http://web.stanford.edu/~pista/MPC.pdf) have shown that "households with low cash-on-hand exhibit a much higher MPC than affluent households." In other words, individuals with little money proportionately spend more than the wealthy. In the view of this, a majority of the economic stimulus is returned back into the economy if the government "injects" the food stamp money to the poor. This is a reasonable argument. If you don't believe me, just remember which giant mega store benefited 14 billions of dollars from food stamps in 2013.   <br><br>    Admittedly, now I am getting theoretical here, but some economic theories like *multiplier effect* postulates that a $1 food stamp can multiply to $2. </p></div>
