<h3> Mapping SNAP (Food Stamps) for Arlington County, Virginia<br><br>

<h4><div class="newspaper1">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
**Introduction**: If you have ever visited the [Arlington County's website](https://departments.arlingtonva.us/dhs/dhs-performance-measurement-program/), you may have noticed that the county's Economic Independence Division has a winning goal: "Increase SNAP participation rate and amount of SNAP benefits issued to eligible Arlington County residents." Asides from altruistic reasons, it is economically sensible for local governments to promote SNAP participation for eligible residents.   <br><br>  Before we begin, I want you to know that I am not advocating for a particular public policy. This blog is not about fueling my political ardor. Believe me. I have my opinions about world matters just like you. But, when it comes to public policy, I want to look at things impartially, free from personal feelings and biases as much as possible. My primary goal is to objectively measure government programs and policies for the good of the public. So, if you're against social policies like food stamps, please hold onto your horses.    <br><br>    That said, why is SNAP economically sensible for local governments? Well, in short-terms, the answer is straightforward. SNAP, formally known as food stamps, is a federal program designed to help low-income earners with groceries. It means that the program is funded by the federal government. When residents spend that federal money in their neighborhood, their regional economic activity increases. And, with the additional economic movement, local governments generate more revenue from taxes.  <br><br>    It isn't just local governments that can benefit from food stamps. Food stamps are a major source of revenue for many businesses. Take Walmart for example. [In 2013, Walmart siphoned nearly 18 percent of all SNAP purchases, which equals to about 14 billion dollars](https://www.wsj.com/articles/grocers-brace-for-reduction-in-food-stamps-1383168686?tesla=y). Even for a company that generates about half a trillion dollars each year, the SNAP program is a lucrative market. So, why would any economist tasked to revitalize their local government not consider promoting SNAP?</p></div>  <br><br><br>

<div style="abstract">

<h4><div class="newspaper1">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another reason local governments might want to increase SNAP participation rate, albeit a debatable argument, is that of something called *marginal propensity to consume (MPC)*. In the context of our discussion, MPC is simply the proportion of income that people spend on purchasing goods. So, for example, if you spend 75 cents per dollar of your income, then you have a high MPC. On the other hand, if you spend 30 cents per dollar, then you have a low MPC rate.   <br><br>    Since low-income earners have little money, buy inexpensive stuff or live a frugal lifestyle, it may be intuitive to think that low-income earners spend only a small portion of their income on purchasing goods. However, [some empirical studies](http://web.stanford.edu/~pista/MPC.pdf) have shown that "households with low cash-on-hand exhibit a much higher MPC than affluent households." In other words, people who have little money proportionately spend more than the wealthy.   <br><br>    Now, we know that low-income earners proportionately spend most of their income, and SNAP grants cannot be deposited into recipients' bank accounts as cash. So, theoretically speaking, nearly 100% of the food stamp money returns to the economy when the government *injects* the food stamp to the poor. This is a reasonable argument. If you don't believe me, just remember which mega store benefited 14 billion dollars from food stamps in 2013 alone.</p></div><br><br><br>

Of course, many taxpayers voice against food stamps because it’s not *free money* per se. The issue often arises from the fact that taxpayers fund programs like SNAP and concerns about welfare fraud exacerbate the stigma associated with food stamps. Take a look at the chart below. It's a list of words Arlington residents use to describe "Food Stamps" on Twitter.</p></div><br><br><br>

As you can see, the public's sentiment of food stamps is saturated with words like illegal, fraud, fears, criminal, scam, millions, etc. Indeed, SNAP is an expensive program that costs the United States government billions of dollars every year. Just in 2015, we spent [$75 billion on SNAP](http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-introduction-to-the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap). However, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an "overwhelming majority of non-disabled, working-age households that start receiving SNAP do not stop working." In fact, a whopping 96% of households that held jobs before receiving SNAP benefits continued working after receiving SNAP the following year, which is a comparable figure to the [national labor turnover rate](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf) that spans 1.2% to 7%    <br><br>  Please note: I conducted the Tweeter public survey post-2016. But, our timespan of interest is 2014-2016. This means that any changes in the political atmosphere (i.e. The presidential election) can present a confounding condition.</p></div><br><br><br>

**Analysis**: A recent job interview I had with the Arlington County’s Department of Human Services inspired me to write this blog. The position’s role entailed analyzing public data in the Quality and Administration Division (Yup, would it not be an ideal job for me?). So, I studied their program management tool by analyzing the [SNAP performance plan report](https://arlingtonva.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/01/EID-SNAP-FY-2016-PMP.pdf).</p></div><br><br><br>

Several parts struck out to me in the report. First, the number of applications and beneficiaries have been declining over the past three years. Since a person must submit SNAP application before becoming a recipient, I wanted to see if there was any relationship between the declining number of applications and individuals receiving SNAP benefits.</p></div><br><br><br>

This is a perfect correlationship. It is always exciting to see textbook examples happening in the real world. Of course, a correlationship does not imply causation. A drop in the number of applications may not lead to a decrease in the number of SNAP recipients. It is reasonable to estimate an increase in the number of SNAP recipients even when there is a decline in the number of applications. Nonetheless, a perfect correlationship is a fascinating phenomenon. I am going to keep this finding in mind.    <br><br>    Next, I will examine how Arlington County performs in relation to the State of Virginia and the nation as a whole. We have to always create a *baseline* in which a measurement is compared to because, without a baseline, we cannot know whether a measured score is high or low. </p></div><br><br><br>

Cool, now we know that Arlington County's SNAP participation rate is significantly lower than the state or national average. We can also see that SNAP rates had increased across the board since the year 2007.    <br><br>    Why is 2007 noteworthy? In December 2007, United States suffered [the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression](http://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/chart-book-the-legacy-of-the-great-recession). The financial stress caused by [the recession forced millions of people to abandon their homes and businesses](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/36231884/ns/business- eye_on_the_economy/t/study-million-households-lost-recession/#.WO0oGlLlSAw), displacing countless families across the nation out into the streets. It was a heartfelt shock that touched many, and some of us still see the world through the broken window that was shattered during the housing market collapse. So yeah, I think the Great Recession had a lot to do with the increase in the food stamp participation.    <br><br>    In addition, we found a discrepancy in the Arlington County's Performance Plan report and the Census data. Take a look at the Arlington's data illustrating the SNAP trend of 2014-16 years, then compare that with the trend observed in the above chart. You will notice that according to Arlington County, the *number* of SNAP recipients have declined over the years. However, in the Census data, the *rate* of SNAP participation had increased. Unfortunately, 2016 census data is not available at this time (May, 2017). </p></div><br><br><br>

<h3> Arlington vs. Census <br>
<h4><div class="code2">
<p style="text-align: left;">
\ | 2014    | 2015    | 2016
------- | ------- | ------- | ------- 
Recipients by Number (Arlington method) | 5,037   | 4,697   | 4,455
Recipients by Percent (Census method) | 3.6%   | 4.3%   | N.A.
</p></div><br><br><br>

<h4><div class="newspaper1">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As you can see, when we juxtapose the two reports together in the form of *number vs. percent*, we learn that the declining trend observed in the number of recipients is not quite true. In actuality, the opposite is correct — the rate of SNAP participation increased.   <br><br>    It may seem like I am being nit-picking something trivial for no speical reason, but this observation is worth pointing it out. If you take a look at the [Arlington County's SNAP Performance Report](https://arlingtonva.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/01/EID-SNAP-FY-2016-PMP.pdf), the program purpose says "Increase SNAP participation **rate** and amount of SNAP benefits issued to eligible Arlington County residents." Well, I can see how the *amount* of SNAP benefits have decreased in the form of dollar quantity, but the SNAP benefit rate did not decrease.   <br><br>  However, it is too early to make any conclusion just yet. SO, enough with my hysteria. I am now interested in knowing why the SNAP participation rate in Arlington County is significantly lower than the rest of the country. Let's take a look at the economic changes of Arlington County. </p></div><br><br><br>

Had there been an option, I would have created an animated map showing changes of economic condition in the Arlington County. Unlucky for nerds like me, the Census data only goes so far back to 2009, and even 2009 was not a complete set. I could have performed something like multiple imputation to substitue the missing values, but that's not necessary because it is pretty obvious looking at the 2010-2015 changes that poverty population has increased over the span of five years.    <br><br>    Although choropleth graphs (maps) transform abstract thoughts into a concrete geospatial inference, it is not enough to grasp a firm understanding of overall trends. Therefore, I will take a look at line plots.</p></div><br><br><br>

The line plot represents the poverty rate, and barplot illustrates the SNAP participation rate. The blues, greens, and greys represent Arlington County, State of Virginia, and the United States, respectively. Notice that the difference between Arlington poverty and SNAP participation rate is wider than those observed in Virginia and the country. The year 2015 was an exception because the poverty level dramatically declined during that year, for unknown reasons.    <br><br>    For the administrators at the Economic Independence Division, this is a good news. Economically speaking, Arlington County is performing better than the rest of the country. Additionally, after analyzing the poverty and SNAP data this way, the program purpose found in [SNAP Performance Report](https://arlingtonva.s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/01/EID-SNAP-FY-2016-PMP.pdf) coherently and accurately aligns itself to why Arlington County should focus on increasing SNAP participation **rate**. </p></div><br><br><br>
